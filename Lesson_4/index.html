            <Section class="post-body">
                <p>This is the body section of the blog. In this section, I will write about the <em>Black Power Movement</em>. I will be sure to use <abbr title="HyperText Markup Langauge 5">HTML5</abbr> tags I've been learning.
                </p>

                <p>This is a paragraph that I will be be qouting the amazing, <strong>Kwame Ture</strong>, who once said <q>Black Power</q>.</p>

                <p>This country knows what power is. It knows it very well. And it knows what Black Power is 'cause it deprived black people of it for 400 years. So it knows what Black Power is. That the question of, Why do black people–Why do white people in this country associate Black Power with violence? And the question is because of their own inability to deal with <q>blackness.</q></p>
                
                <p>If we had said <q>Negro power</q> nobody would get scared. Everybody would support it. Or if we said power for colored people, everybody’d be for that, but it is the word <em>black</em> -- it is the word <strong><q>black</q></strong> that bothers people in this country, and that’s their problem, not mine -- they're problem, they're problem.</p>
