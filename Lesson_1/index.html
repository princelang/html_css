            <h2>I am writing raps.</h2>
            <p>Rapping is a musical form of vocal delivery that incorporates <em>"rhyme, rhythmic speech, and street vernacular",</em> which is performed or chanted in a variety of ways, usually over a backing beat or musical accompaniment.</p>

            <h3>Why am I writing raps?</h3>
            <p>Because I want to express myself.</p>

            <h4>Sharing raps online is easy!</h4>
            <p>I can share them on a <strong>website</strong> like this one.</p>
